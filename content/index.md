This workshop is an introduction to text analysis for humanities scholars using Voyant Tools. We will begin by looking at a variety of text analysis projects and discuss numerous popular text analysis methodologies. We will then install the Voyant Server and explore the tools avialable while discussing the potential applications for teaching, research, and public humanities projects.
